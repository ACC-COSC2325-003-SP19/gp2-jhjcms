* Chosen Device Description
	* Source - John Hemann
		* The company that made our device is called Parallax. Their founder was Chip Gracey and he made the company in 1987. They make a wide variety hardware like microcontrollers, robots, sensors, and boards. They also make a ton of devices that are aimed at teaching people about the basics of programming with devices like the Ping. Because of their goal to educate people, they also have programs to teach people from elementary school to college.
	* Basic Features - Garrett Dipalma
		* The Uno board has seven general pins and six special function pins. It also uses the ATmega328p AVR (8-bit) microcontroller, it weighs 28 grams. it has a flash memory storage of 32 kB and does 20 MIPS (20 Million Instructions per second).
	:1. LED: There is one LED on the board. It is one when it has a HIGH value and off when it has a LOW value.
	:2. VIN (Input Voltage): The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source.
	:3. 5V: This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V).
	:4. 3V3: A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator.
	:5. GND: Ground pin.
	:6 IOREF: This pin on the Arduino Uno R3 board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates
	:7. Reset: a resettable polyfuse that protects your computer's USB ports from shorts and overcurrent when more than  500 mA is applied to the USB port
	
	* Special pins
	:1. Serial: Pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data.
	:2. External Interupts: Pins 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value
	:3. PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): Pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Provide 8-bit PWM output with analog functions.
	:4. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): Pins 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library.
	:5. TWI (Two Wire Interface): A4 or SDA pin and A5 or SCL pin. Support TWI communication. 
	:6. AREF (Analog REFerence): References voltage with analog inputs.
	
	
* Controlling the device
	* We used pin 7 which is on PORTD on the Arduino board. This is the only pin required because it swaps between input and output.
* Device demonstration
	* How will you show off this device
* Project Code
	* Any code your team authored. SOurces for other parts are fine
